# NgWeatherWidget

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build Angular Elements

To compile the Angular elements in this project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run elembuild
```

This command builds the elements and bundles them into the `elements` folder.

## Running the index.html page

The `index.html` page in the root folder is a plain HTML page using the Angular element. To run this page, install [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) and run it on the root folder using the command `lite-server`. Then open the URL http://localhost:8080 on the browser to see how it works.
